        <h2>Potentially Harmful Language and Content</h2>
        <p>Burns Library and the BC Libraries are committed to <a href="https://libguides.bc.edu/edi" target="_blank">diversity, equity, and inclusion</a>. We are aware that descriptions in our Finding Aids (this site) and <a href="https://library.bc.edu/" target="_blank">Library Catalog</a> have been created over time using standards rooted in systems of harm (e.g. colonialism, racism, sexism, homophobia) and utilizing the dated language of individuals and organizations who made the materials themselves. We are also aware that materials in our collections may be objectionable and offensive; we believe it is important to preserve the past so that we can learn from it. We are actively working to improve the language we use, highlight hidden voices, and contextualize materials; however, there is much work to do.</p>
